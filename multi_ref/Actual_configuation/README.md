This Folder implements the Path Tracking MPC for a Four Wheel Steering Robot

To run the simulation install CasADi and add the installation folder into the main

The main - PP_4WS_path_tracking_MS - loads the three column vectors representing x,y points plus the path length

This parametrization allows moving freely in the plane without any singularity
