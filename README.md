# Model Predictive Control (MPC) Implementations

This repository contains various implementations of Model Predictive Control (MPC) using CasADi for problem formulation and the interior point method for solving the resulting nonlinear programming (NLP) problems.

## Overview

Model Predictive Control is an advanced method of process control that has been in use in the process industries since the 1980s. This project explores different MPC implementations, providing a platform for learning, comparison, and further development of MPC algorithms.

## Features

- Multiple MPC implementations
- Utilization of CasADi for efficient formulation of optimal control problems
- Interior point method for solving nonlinear programming problems
- MATLAB integration for visualization and analysis

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
- [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/)
